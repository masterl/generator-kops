# Kops

Project structure for SPA development using KnockoutJS, Pug and Stylus


## Install

- Copy files
- npm install
- npm run dev
- if you have `entr` installed:
 - `./autoreload.sh` to automatically refresh Firefox (edit the script to target another browser)

## Note:

I got this idea from https://github.com/SteveSanderson/generator-ko
But the project seems to no longer be maintaned, and I also wanted to remember some stuff and improve on this idea
